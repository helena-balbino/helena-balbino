# Hi there üëã  
## I'm Helena Balbino

With over **15 years of experience in accounting**, I have spent years managing administrative processes, conducting tax reviews, and implementing routines that optimized internal workflows and ensured regulatory compliance for companies of various sizes. Throughout my career, I have developed analytical and problem-solving skills that now serve as the foundation for my work in Data Science, combining business knowledge with the ability to interpret and transform information into strategic decisions.

I am currently pursuing a **Postgraduate Specialization in Machine Learning and Big Data**, deepening my knowledge in processing and analyzing large datasets, developing machine learning models, and applying artificial intelligence techniques. I have been working on solutions ranging from exploratory data analysis to predictive modeling and anomaly detection approaches, always focusing on practical application and delivering measurable results. This training complements my professional experience in accounting and administration, enhancing my ability to transform data into relevant information to support strategic decision-making.
